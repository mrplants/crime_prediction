			  # the outputs should be of format (35 by 1) or (36 by 1) => the extra variable being there for 0/1 if there is enough crime or not (think of the region over the water)

	shape = (155928, 256,256)

	155928 because we have 6497 days and 24 times of day => 6497 * 24 = 155928  # we have to shave off the last day to be equal to x__Lentries_ dataset

	Okay, the format of 1 image is 256,256. The type of murder is actually at the coordinate. 
	That is, on the image on pixel (1,3) if there was a category 4 crime, there will be a 4 there. On the 
	same image, if there is a category 7 crime at (253,6), there will be a 7 there. I did this so that regardless
	of the shape we choose 64 by 64 or 32 by 32, we can generate a count of each category and one hot encode it.
